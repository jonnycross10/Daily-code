Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. 
In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. 
The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

Psuedo Code:
make a loop to compare every number in given array with, starting at one, all the way till the end of the array.
make another loop to go through each element of the array, and count how many times the element doesn't match the one 
you're comparing to. if the number of falses = the size of the array then print out the element your first array is at, 
because that's the first missing number.
